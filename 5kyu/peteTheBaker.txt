Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. Unfortunately he is not good in maths. Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.



Solution:


function cakes(recipe, available) {
  
  let answer;
  
  // make an array that contains the name and quantity of available items that match the recipe items
  let workingList = Object.entries(recipe).filter(hasIngredients);
 
  // for each recipe ingredient, divide the quantity in stock by the amount called for by the recipe
  
  workingList.forEach(item => {
    // if undefined then set answer , else check if result is smaller than answer
    if(answer == undefined) {
      answer = Math.floor(available[item[0]] / item[1])
    } else if((Math.floor(available[item[0]] / item[1])) < answer) {
    answer = Math.floor(available[item[0]] / item[1])
    }
  })
  
  function hasIngredients (item) {
    return available.hasOwnProperty(item[0])
  }
  
  // check if ingredient list is longer than list of items in stock
  
  if(Object.keys(recipe).length > Object.keys(available).length) {
    answer = 0;
  }
  return answer;
 
}
